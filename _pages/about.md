I am PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay and at the Laboratoire Math√©matiques d'Orsay since september 2018 under the supervision of [Thomas Alazard ](http://talazard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/) . My PhD title is "On the regularity of the flow of the Euler equations without Boundary". I am interested in mathematical analysis, functional analysis and the analysis of PDE.
