I am a Chargé de recherche au CNRS at Laboratoire de Mathématiques de Reims (LMR - UMR 9008).

Currently, I am a member of the ANR project SmaSH (Emergent Small-scale Structures in Hydrodynamic models), 2025-2030.

During my Postdoc, I was a Research Associate at [Cambridge University](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/) hosted by [Pierre Raphaël](https://www.maths.cam.ac.uk/person/pr463). I was also a Griffiths Research Assistant Professor at [Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/), hosted by [Tarek M. Elgindi](https://sites.google.com/view/tarekelgindi/home).

I obtained my PhD at [ENS Paris-Saclay](https://ens-paris-saclay.fr/en) and at the [Laboratoire Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/) under the supervision of [Thomas Alazard](http://talazard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). I am interested in mathematical analysis, microlocal analysis, the analysis of PDE and fluid mechanics.

<!--- I am currently a [Program](https://www.msri.org/programs/327) associate at MSRI, Berkley.--->
