I am PhD student at ENS Paris-Saclay and at the Laboratoire Mathématiques d'Orsay since september 2018 under the supervision of [Thomas Alazard](http://talazard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). My PhD title is "On the regularity of the flow of the Euler equations without Boundary." I am interested in mathematical analysis, functional analysis, the analysis of PDE and fluid mechanics.
