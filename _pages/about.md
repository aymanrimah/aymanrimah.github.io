I am a Griffiths Research Assistant Professor at [Duke University](https://math.duke.edu/), hosted by [Pr. Tarek Elgindi](http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~telgindi/).

I Obtained my PhD at ENS Paris-Saclay and at the Laboratoire Math√©matiques d'Orsay under the supervision of [Thomas Alazard](http://talazard.perso.math.cnrs.fr/). My PhD title is "On the regularity of the flow of the Euler equations without Boundary." I am interested in mathematical analysis, functional analysis, the analysis of PDE and fluid mechanics.

<!--- I am currently a [Program](https://www.msri.org/programs/327) associate at MSRI, Berkley.--->
