  In the first part of this paper we prove that the flow associated to the Burgers equation with a non local term
 of the form <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H\langle D \rangle^\alpha u " /> fails
 to be uniformly continuous from bounded sets of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H^s(\mathbb D)" /> 
 to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^0([0,T],H^s(\mathbb D))" /> for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? T>0, " /> <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?s>\frac{1}{2}+\max(\alpha,1), \ 0\leq \alpha <2," />
 <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex? \ \mathbb D=\mathbb R \ \text{or} \ \mathbb T," /> and H is the Hilbert transform. 
 Furthermore we show that the flow can not be <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^1" /> 
from bounded sets of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?H^s(\mathbb D)" /> to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?C^0([0,T],H^{s-1+(\alpha-1)^+ +\epsilon}(\mathbb D)),\ \text{for } \epsilon>0 " />.
We generalize this result to a large class of non linear transport-dispersive equations in any dimension, that in particular 
   contains the Whitham equation and the paralinearisation of the water waves system with and without surface tension. 
    The current result is optimal in the sense that for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\alpha=2 \ \text{and } \mathbb D=\mathbb T" /> 
    the flow associated to the Benjamin-Ono equation is Lipschitz.
    In the second part of this paper we apply this method to deduce the quasi-linearity of the water waves system, which is the main result of this paper.
