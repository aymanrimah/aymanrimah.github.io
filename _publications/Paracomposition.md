In this paper we revisit the hypothesis needed to define the ”para- composition” operator, an analogue to the classic pull back operation in the low regularity setting, first introduced by S. Alinhac. More precisely we drop the diffeomorphism hypothesis thus fully generalizing Bony’s classic paralinear- asition Theorem. We give a proof to the change of variables in paradifferential operators.
