In the first part of this paper we prove that the flow associated to the Burgers equation with a non local term of the form 
$D^{\alpha-1} \partial_x u$, $\alpha \in [1,+\infty[$ is Lipschitz from bounded sets of $H^s_0({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R})$ to 
$C^0([0,T],H^{s-(2-\alpha)^+}_0({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R}))$ for $T>0$ and $s>1+\frac{1}{2}$, where $H^s_0$ are the Sobolev spaces 
of function with $0$ mean value, proving that the result obtained previously by the author is optimal on the torus. 
We also prove that passing from $H^s_0({\mathbb T})$ to $H^s({\mathbb T})$ induces a loss of regularity on the flow map i.e 
it is not uniformly continuous from $H^s({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R})$ to $C^0([0,T],H^{s}({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R}))$ and is not 
Lipschitz from bounded sets of 
$H^s({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R})$ to $C^0([0,T],H^{s-1 +\epsilon}({\mathbb T};{\mathbb R})),\epsilon>0$. 
We give an analogous example on ${\mathbb R}$ clarifying the need of the $0$ mean value hypothesis. 
The proof relies on a pseudodifferential generalization of a complex Cole-Hopf gauge transformation introduced by T.Tao for the 
Benjamin-Ono equation. In the second part of this paper we use a paralinearisation version of the previous method to prove that 
the flow of the one dimensional periodic Gravity Capillary equations is Lipschitz from bounded sets of $H^s$ verifying
some symmetry hypothesis to $C^0([0,T],H^{s-\frac{1}{2}})$ for $T>0$ and $s>\frac{5}{2}+\frac{1}{2}$ proving that the result 
obtained previously by the author is optimal for the Water Waves system. 
We present for this a general scheme for the study of the flow map regularity in PDE, which is the main result of this paper.
