We study the paralinearised weakly dispersive Burgers type equation: 
$$\partial_t u+\partial_x [T_u u]-T_{\frac{\partial_x u}{2}}u+\partial_x D^{\alpha-1}u=0,\ \alpha \in ]1,2[,$$
which contains the main non linear "worst interaction" terms, i.e low-high interaction terms, of the usual weakly dispersive Burgers type equation:
$$\partial_t u+u\partial_x u+\partial_x D^{\alpha-1}u=0,\ \alpha \in ]1,2[,$$ with $u_0 \in H^s(\mathbb D)$, where $\mathbb D=\mathbb T \text{ or } \mathbb R$. 

Through a paradifferential complex Cole-Hopf type gauge transform we introduced previously by the author for the study of the flow map regularity of Gravity-Capillary equation, we prove a new a priori estimate in $H^s(\mathbb D)$ under the control of:  
$$\left\Vert (1+\left\Vert u\right \Vert_{L^\infty_x})\left\Vert u \right \Vert_{W^{2-\alpha,\infty}_x} \right \Vert_{L^1_t}$$, improving upon the usual hyperbolic control
